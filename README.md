Immersive AI - Project Summary

As I mentioned way back when (eek it has been 7 months since I posted this), my final year uni project was all about developing an AI engine within TGE. Well I am now well and truely finished with uni, working fulltime for a telecoms software company - ok so it's not games, but very performance programming based :).

After resurrecting myself out of the hole that can be a certain MMO that apparently 8 million other people tend to like (guess which!), I'm getting back into TGE; ok well actually I'm starting out with TGEA now, but thats for another blog.

Immersive AI
------------
Well for anyone who can't remember (ok I can't even remember back that long), here is a basic overview of what Immersive AI was all about...

The aim of this project was to create a game artificial intelligence system, to assist in the creation of an immersive game world. The implemented system was to allow computer controlled game agents to act, react and interact with the game world in a seemingly intelligent manner.
The key objectives of the implemented system were as follows:

1. To create an artificial intelligence system which controls AI agents that interact with the game as seemingly intelligent entities
2. To design a general system which can be implemented for various goal-states and game types
3. To implement a system which has minimal impact on game performance

(Basically make AI characters act like real people, in a fast, efficient way)

Implemented in the system was a path finding system and a complete non-deterministic AI reasoning engine!

Just a couple of screenshots below, showing the pathfinding nodes and a couple of the agents (a bandit and a soldier) fighting each other...

lost!

For a more details overview, have a look at some of the documentation I've linked below; also in my previous blog posts there is screenshots of the path finding system :)

: I've moved the docs into the SDK Private forums thread: www.garagegames.com/mg/forums/result.thread.php?qt=58585


Feel free to use any of the code in the implementation document - I hope that it is of use to someone when trying to navigate around the lovely world of AI. It is by no means the best possible implementation but it should serve as a good starting ground.


Where to from here?
-------------------
Well after completing my first AI system, I have learnt a hell of a lot about what to do and what not to do... until I blog again, you'll just have to wait and see.
